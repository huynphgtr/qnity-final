            One of the most striking features of Nhon Ly is its winding, narrow alleyways, thoughtfully designed to block strong sea winds and provide shade. Strolling through these paths, you’ll pass by rows of old-style homes that preserve traditional architecture—with whitewashed walls, red-tiled roofs, and open courtyards, often used for drying fish or hanging laundry.
