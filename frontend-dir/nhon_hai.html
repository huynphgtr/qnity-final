          <p>
            Famed as the most captivating destination in Nhon Hai Fishing Village, Hòn Khô lies just beside the village and leaves a lasting impression with its untouched beauty — where mountains, greenery, crystal-clear waters, and white sandy beaches come together in perfect harmony.

          <p>
            A remnant of the once-glorious Champa Kingdom in the land of Xứ Nẫu, this ancient coastal wall lies right by the sea, mysteriously appearing and disappearing with the ebb and flow of the waves. Often referred to as the "path through the sea," it offers a unique experience — strolling across the submerged walkway as cool seawater gently flows between your toes. It's a must-try for those seeking something different on their journey to Nhon Hai Fishing Village.

          <p>
            On your adventure through Nhon Hai Fishing Village, one of the most authentic ways to connect with local life is to join the fishermen at sea. Hop aboard a traditional basket boat and help them haul in nets full of fish and shrimp. As you drift with the waves and listen to the rhythmic splash of water against the boat, you’ll find a rare sense of peace and poetic charm that soothes the soul.
