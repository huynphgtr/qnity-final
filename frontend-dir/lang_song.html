            Lang Song Minor Seminary (also known as Lang Song Church) is located about 10km northeast of Quy Nhon city center. The name "Lang Song" translates to "River Village," referring to its picturesque setting amidst waterways and lush green rice fields. Between 1841 and 1850, the seminary was originally constructed with modest materials—bamboo walls and thatched roofs. It wasn’t until 1927 that a larger, more solid church was built on a 2,000 m² plot of land. Later, the printing house of the Diocese of Dong Dang Trong and the bishop’s residence were also established on the site.
          </p>
          <p>
            Under the direction of Father Paul Maheu—who had studied printing in Hong Kong—the Lang Song printing house became one of the three most significant centers in Vietnam for literature in the Romanized Vietnamese script and for promoting its use.
          </p>
          <p>
            To reach Lang Song Minor Seminary from Quy Nhon, visitors can follow National Highway 19. Along the way, they can also explore other notable attractions in Binh Dinh, such as Long Phuoc Martial Arts Pagoda, Thien Hung Pagoda, and Banh It Towers.

            The Significance of Lang Song Church
          </h2>
          <p>
            In the past, Lang Song Church primarily served as a monastery for minor seminarians to study theology and cultivate their spiritual path. After completing their training, these seminarians would move on to major seminaries to further their journey toward priesthood. At its peak, nearly 200 seminarians from across the Central Coastal provinces of Vietnam studied and lived on the premises.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, the church no longer functions as a seminary but has become a spiritual destination and cultural tourism site. On important occasions—such as Catholic holidays or the Lunar New Year—both locals and tourists visit to attend mass, offer prayers, enjoy the peaceful atmosphere, and explore the historical printing exhibition housed within the church grounds.

          <p>
            With a history spanning over 170 years, Lang Song Minor Seminary still preserves its distinctive Gothic architecture. Upon entering the church grounds, visitors are drawn to the central chapel—featuring three main entrances and sixteen exquisitely carved doors supported by massive wooden columns. On either side are the former working and study areas of seminarians. The sanctuary’s intricately carved altar, religious statues, and detailed reliefs highlight the hallmark elements of Gothic design, including arched doorways and pointed vaults.
